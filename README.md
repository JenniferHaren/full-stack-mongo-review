#Exercise-2 <br />
In your database directory, create a file called index.js and establish a connection to your mongo database using mongoose. Export the connection to the your models.js file and create the schema that you will want to use to store your todolist data.

#Exercise-3 <br />
In your database directory, create a file called mongoDBHelpers.js and build out the functionality for GET, POST, and UPDATE requests.

#Exercise-5 <br />
In your client, create a component called App and render it the DOM.

#Exercise-6 <br />
Build out a class component called List. Inside of the component, build out functionality that will allow the user to enter a todo in an input field and send a request to your server where that data will be saved.

#Exercise-7 <br />
Inside of your List component, build out functionality that will make a get request to your database and fetch all of the todos from the list. Save those todos to an array on the client side.

#Exercise-8 <br />
Create a functional component called ListEntry and have it list out the todos stored in the array. Build functionality that will allow the user to edit/update the todo by clicking on a button.
